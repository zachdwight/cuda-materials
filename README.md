Older scripts I'm pulling off an old research box.  I'll try and rewrite or fix up in case they could help someone.

## Scripts

- CUDA_test.py : benchmark CPU vs GPU with basic function, helps confirm performance on legacy and newer systems
- queryGenome_with_CUDA.py : use GPU for calculating differences when querying genome products of ideal size
